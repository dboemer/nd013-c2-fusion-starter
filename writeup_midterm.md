# Mid-Term Project: 3D Object Detection

This is the mid-term project of the section "Sensor Fusion and Tracking" in [Udacity's Nanodegree Program "Self Driving Car Engineer"](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd0013).

## 1. Compute Lidar Point-Cloud from Range Image
### 1.1. Visualize Range Image Channels (ID_S1_EX1)
### 1.2. Visualize Point-Cloud (ID_S1_EX2)

## 2. Create Birds-Eye View from Lidar PCL
### 2.1 Convert Sensor Coordinates to BEV-Map Coordinates (ID_S2_EX1)
### 2.2 Compute Intensity Layer of BEV-Map (ID_S2_EX2)
### 2.3 Compute Height Layer of BEV-Map (ID_S2_EX3)

## 3. Model-based Object Detection in BEV Image
### 3.1 Add a Second Model from a GitHub Repo (ID_S3_EX1)
### 3.2 Extract 3D Bounding Boxes from Model Response (ID_S3_EX2)

## 4. Performance Evaluation for Object Detection
### 4.1 Compute Intersection-over-Union (IOU) between labels and detections (ID_S4_EX1)
### 4.2 Compute False-Negatives and False-Positives (ID_S4_EX2)
### 4.3 Compute Precision and Recall (ID_S4_EX3)
